CS-5500 Managing Software Development Project

Outdoorsy

Designed and developed a web application project where customers can search for outdoor events and activities happening around them. The course covered software life cycle models (waterfall, spiral, and so forth), domain engineering methods, requirements analysis methods (including formal specifications), software design principles and methods, verification and testing methods, resource and schedule estimation for individual software engineers, component-based software development methods and architecture, and languages for describing software processes. Agile principles in software development were followed at each step of the process beginning from feasibility report, component design to go-live of the project; a pseudo work environment was setup as part of the course to develop this project.
